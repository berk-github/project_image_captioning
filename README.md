# project_image_captioning

The Microsoft Common Objects in COntext (MS COCO) dataset is a large-scale dataset for scene understanding. The dataset is commonly used to train and benchmark object detection, segmentation, and captioning algorithms.

You can read more about the dataset on the [website](http://cocodataset.org/#home) or in the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.0312.pdf).


In the project, I will use this dataset to train my own model to generate captions from images!
